# The ChatKC Protocol

ChatKC is a protocol that originated from [MattKC](https://www.youtube.com/@MattKC)'s website [here](https://stream.mattkc.com/) and reverse engineered by [Breadpudding](https://github.com/cbpudding) and [janKonku](https://github.com/zegfarce) on January 16th, 2023. After playing around with the protocol for hours, MattKC found us hanging out and decided to tweak the protocol a bit to make things easier for us to work with. This document describes the protocol that was created as a result.

![Breadpudding: He's here but he's not active
MattKC: lol hey i didn't know people would still be here
Breadpudding: Oh heck
Platapai: yooo
MattKC: gonna work on some improvements
Breadpudding: Improvements? This webchat is already perfect.
Platapai: ^^^
janKonku: it's particularly nice for alternate clients
Breadpudding: That we may or may not be writing as we speak
janKonku: very little in the way of coding needed to connect to it and have it working
Breadpudding: Maybe reduce the rate limiting when you aren't streaming?](images/protocol1.png)

![MattKC: there is an argument for sending the time with the message, it could be nice even on here to be able to see exactly when a message was sent
MattKC: it's obviously recorded in the database but isn't sent to the client
Breadpudding: Wait, there's a database for this?
Breadpudding: Your poor server lol
janKonku: did you record the one test packet i sent
MattKC: yes the chat is backed by a database
janKonku: should be type 'test' :)](images/protocol2.png)

## Connectivity

In order to connect to a ChatKC server, you must establish a secure WebSocket connection to TCP port 2002 and send the "hello" event to the server. Once the server sends the initial burst of "message" events followed by "join" events, bidirectional communication can take place.

## Event Format

All events sent to and received from the server are JSON objects containing the `type` and `data` attributes. The `type` attribute will always be a string that describes the information found in the `data` attribute.

In addition to those two fields, events sent to the server are required to have the `auth` and `token` attributes. In the reference implementation of the server, `auth` is always set to the string "google" and `token` is set to your OAuth2 token.

## Event Types

### Clientbound Event Types

#### accepted

This event means that the server has acknowledged the last message you sent. The `data` for this type is an object with the `message` attribute set to the content of your last message.

Example:
```JSON
{
    "type": "accepted",
    "data": {
        "message": "Hello world!"
    }
}
```

#### authlevel

This event informs the client of their current authentication level. The `data` for this type is an object with the `value` attribute set to a number corresponding to your current authentication level.

Example:
```JSON
{
    "type": "authlevel",
    "data": {
        "value": 0
    }
}
```

#### chat

This event informs the client of a new message. The `data` for this type is an object with the following attributes:

| Name           | Type     | Description                                                                        |

| `author_level` | `number` | The authentication level of the message author                                     |
| `donate_value` | `string` | The donation amount given in USD (or an empty string for no donation)              |
| `id`           | `number` | The identifier of the message itself                                               |
| `message`      | `string` | The contents of the message                                                        |
